Thanks for your assistance with that! The next task I have is a little more intensive. After discussing with friends, we have decided that it might be nice to rework the beacon system. We still want to keep the tier system, where players have to build a pyramid and place the beacon on it, and have accessible effects from the beacon depending on the tier size, but we want to make it so that when a power is selected using a form of payment, (ingots, etc.) the selected power is applied to everyone within 10 blocks, and sticks with them for a given amount of time, regardless of how far away they get from the beacon. Time can be added by giving more ingots or other accepted valuables. When time is added, any new players who might be in the required radius of the beacon are entered into the beacon system as well. Hopefully this all makes sense so far. If a different effect is selected on the beacon, it resets the beacon, and its time, and removes the effect from all players associated with the beacon. If possible, would there be a way to change the beacon beam color depending on the effect, and adjust the value (brightness) of the color based on how much time left? (darker color as time runs out.)

Here are the defaults for the time adders. I want these times to be configurable in seconds through the world specific config file, and also through the dd command:
- Iron: 3 min,
- Gold: 5 min,
- Emerald: 10 min,
- Diamond: 30 min,
- Netherite: 6 hrs

This project will likely require the following:
- Tracking players' beacon associations, and allowing players to be associated with multiple beacons
- Configurable beacon application radius, perhaps the radius depends on the size of the beacon pyramid?
- Saving associations and times between server restarts / world saves and exits
- Syncing the time of the beacon w/ player effect time (if a player joins later on, they don't have the effect time they had when they left. They have whatever the beacon dictates is left.)

I also want to have particle effects for the beacon and fun little sounds. When the effect is applied, I want there to be a particle border in a square of the application area to nearby players. I want this area to last about 5 seconds, and once its gone, new players can't be added to the application pool until a new time addition.

I know this is a lot! I hope you can make it work. For your convenience, I have attached ref-decompiled which includes all of the unobfuscated minecraft codebase. Please reference it as you need to. Please keep in mind that I want to keep this all as serverside as possible. Thanks!
